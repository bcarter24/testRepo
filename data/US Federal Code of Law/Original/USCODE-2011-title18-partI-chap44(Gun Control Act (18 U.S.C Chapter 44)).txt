CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION
Section 1(b) of Pub. L. 99–308 provided that: ‘‘The
Congress finds that—
‘‘(1) the rights of citizens—
‘‘(A) to keep and bear arms under the second
amendment to the United States Constitution;
‘‘(B) to security against illegal and unreasonable
searches and seizures under the fourth amendment;
‘‘(C) against uncompensated taking of property,
double jeopardy, and assurance of due process of
law under the fifth amendment; and
‘‘(D) against unconstitutional exercise of authority under the ninth and tenth amendments;
require additional legislation to correct existing firearms statutes and enforcement policies; and
‘‘(2) additional legislation is required to reaffirm
the intent of the Congress, as expressed in section 101§ 921 TITLE 18—CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE Page 208
of the Gun Control Act of 1968 [section 101 of Pub. L.
90–618, set out below], that ‘it is not the purpose of
this title to place any undue or unnecessary Federal
restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens with
respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms appropriate to the purpose of hunting, trapshooting, target shooting, personal protection, or any
other lawful activity, and that this title is not intended to discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms by law-abiding citizens for
lawful purposes.’.’’
Section 101 of title I of Pub. L. 90–618 provided that:
‘‘The Congress hereby declares that the purposes of this
title [amending this chapter] is to provide support to
Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials in
their fight against crime and violence, and it is not the
purpose of this title to place any undue or unnecessary
Federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens
with respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of
firearms appropriate to the purpose of hunting, trapshooting, target shooting, personal protection, or any
other lawful activity, and that this title is not intended
to discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use
of firearms by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,
or provide for the imposition by Federal regulations of
any procedures or requirements other than those reasonably necessary to implement and effectuate the provisions of this title.’’
Section 901 of title IV of Pub. L. 90–351 provided that:
‘‘(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares—
‘‘(1) that there is a widespread traffic in firearms
moving in or otherwise affecting interstate or foreign
commerce, and that the existing Federal controls
over such traffic do not adequately enable the States
to control this traffic within their own borders
through the exercise of their police power;
‘‘(2) that the ease with which any person can acquire firearms other than a rifle or shotgun (including criminals, juveniles without the knowledge or
consent of their parents or guardians, narcotics addicts, mental defectives, armed groups who would
supplant the functions of duly constituted public authorities, and others whose possession of such weapon
is similarly contrary to the public interest) is a significant factor in the prevalence of lawlessness and
violent crime in the United States;
‘‘(3) that only through adequate Federal control
over interstate and foreign commerce in these weapons, and over all persons engaging in the businesses
of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in them, can
this grave problem be properly dealt with, and effective State and local regulation of this traffic be made
possible;
‘‘(4) that the acquisition on a mail-order basis of
firearms other than a rifle or shotgun by nonlicensed
individuals, from a place other than their State of
residence, has materially tended to thwart the effectiveness of State laws and regulations, and local ordinances;
‘‘(5) that the sale or other disposition of concealable weapons by importers, manufacturers, and dealers holding Federal licenses, to nonresidents of the
State in which the licensees’ places of business are
located, has tended to make ineffective the laws, regulations, and ordinances in the several States and
local jurisdictions regarding such firearms;
‘‘(6) that there is a casual relationship between the
easy availability of firearms other than a rifle or
shotgun and juvenile and youthful criminal behavior,
and that such firearms have been widely sold by federally licensed importers and dealers to emotionally
immature, or thrill-bent juveniles and minors prone
to criminal behavior;
‘‘(7) that the United States has become the dumping ground of the castoff surplus military weapons of
other nations, and that such weapons, and the large
volume of relatively inexpensive pistols and revolvers
(largely worthless for sporting purposes), imported
into the United States in recent years, has contributed greatly to lawlessness and to the Nation’s law
enforcement problems;
‘‘(8) that the lack of adequate Federal control over
interstate and foreign commerce in highly destructive weapons (such as bazookas, mortars, antitank
guns, and so forth, and destructive devices such as explosive or incendiary grenades, bombs, missiles, and
so forth) has allowed such weapons and devices to fall
into the hands of lawless persons, including armed
groups who would supplant lawful authority, thus
creating a problem of national concern;
‘‘(9) that the existing licensing system under the
Federal Firearms Act [former sections 901 to 910 of
Title 15, Commerce and Trade] does not provide adequate license fees or proper standards for the granting or denial of licenses, and that this has led to licenses being issued to persons not reasonably entitled
thereto, thus distorting the purposes of the licensing
system.
‘‘(b) The Congress further hereby declares that the
purpose of this title [enacting this chapter and repealing sections 901 to 910 of Title 15, Commerce and Trade]
is to cope with the conditions referred to in the foregoing subsection, and that it is not the purpose of this
title [enacting this chapter and repealing sections 901
to 910 of Title 15] to place any undue or unnecessary
Federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens
with respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of
firearms appropriate to the purpose of hunting, trap
shooting, target shooting, personal protection, or any
other lawful activity, and that this title [enacting this
chapter and repealing sections 901 to 910 of Title 15] is
not intended to discourage or eliminate the private
ownership or use of firearms by law-abiding citizens for
lawful purposes, or provide for the imposition by Federal regulations of any procedures or requirements
other than those reasonably necessary to implement
and effectuate the provisions of this title [enacting this
chapter and repealing sections 901 to 910 of Title 15].’’

calibrated and operated to detect the Security
Exemplar; or
(B) any major component of which, when
subjected to inspection by the types of x-ray
machines commonly used at airports, does not
generate an image that accurately depicts the
shape of the component. Barium sulfate or
other compounds may be used in the fabrication of the component.
(2) For purposes of this subsection—
(A) the term ‘‘firearm’’ does not include the
frame or receiver of any such weapon;
(B) the term ‘‘major component’’ means,
with respect to a firearm, the barrel, the slide
or cylinder, or the frame or receiver of the
firearm; and
(C) the term ‘‘Security Exemplar’’ means an

Attorney General, that is—
(i) constructed of, during the 12-month period beginning on the date of the enactment
of this subsection, 3.7 ounces of material
type 17–4 PH stainless steel in a shape resembling a handgun; and
(ii) suitable for testing and calibrating
metal detectors:
Provided, however, That at the close of such 12-
month period, and at appropriate times thereafter the Attorney General shall promulgate
regulations to permit the manufacture, importation, sale, shipment, delivery, possession,
transfer, or receipt of firearms previously prohibited under this subparagraph that are as
detectable as a ‘‘Security Exemplar’’ which
contains 3.7 ounces of material type 17–4 PH
stainless steel, in a shape resembling a handgun, or such lesser amount as is detectable in
view of advances in state-of-the-art developments in weapons detection technology.
(3) Under such rules and regulations as the Attorney General shall prescribe, this subsection
shall not apply to the manufacture, possession,
transfer, receipt, shipment, or delivery of a firearm by a licensed manufacturer or any person
acting pursuant to a contract with a licensed
manufacturer, for the purpose of examining and
testing such firearm to determine whether paragraph (1) applies to such firearm. The Attorney
General shall ensure that rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to this paragraph do not imPage 213 TITLE 18—CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE § 922

pair the manufacture of prototype firearms or
the development of new technology.
(4) The Attorney General shall permit the conditional importation of a firearm by a licensed

unconditional importation of such firearm
would violate this subsection.
(5) This subsection shall not apply to any firearm which—
(A) has been certified by the Secretary of
Defense or the Director of Central Intelligence, after consultation with the Attorney
General and the Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration, as necessary for
military or intelligence applications; and
(B) is manufactured for and sold exclusively
to military or intelligence agencies of the
United States.
(6) This subsection shall not apply with respect to any firearm manufactured in, imported

(q)(1) The Congress finds and declares that—
(A) crime, particularly crime involving
drugs and guns, is a pervasive, nationwide
problem;
(B) crime at the local level is exacerbated by
the interstate movement of drugs, guns, and
criminal gangs;
(C) firearms and ammunition move easily in
interstate commerce and have been found in
increasing numbers in and around schools, as
documented in numerous hearings in both the
Committee on the Judiciary3 the House of
Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;
(D) in fact, even before the sale of a firearm,
the gun, its component parts, ammunition,
and the raw materials from which they are
made have considerably moved in interstate
commerce;
(E) while criminals freely move from State
to State, ordinary citizens and foreign visitors
may fear to travel to or through certain parts
of the country due to concern about violent
crime and gun violence, and parents may decline to send their children to school for the
same reason;
(F) the occurrence of violent crime in school
zones has resulted in a decline in the quality
of education in our country;
(G) this decline in the quality of education
has an adverse impact on interstate commerce
and the foreign commerce of the United
States;
(H) States, localities, and school systems
find it almost impossible to handle gun-related crime by themselves—even States, localities, and school systems that have made
strong efforts to prevent, detect, and punish
gun-related crime find their efforts unavailing
due in part to the failure or inability of other
States or localities to take strong measures;
and
(I) the Congress has the power, under the
interstate commerce clause and other provisions of the Constitution, to enact measures to
ensure the integrity and safety of the Nation’s
schools by enactment of this subsection.
(2)(A) It shall be unlawful for any individual
knowingly to possess a firearm that has moved
in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign
commerce at a place that the individual knows,
or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school
zone.
(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the
possession of a firearm—
(i) on private property not part of school
grounds;
(ii) if the individual possessing the firearm is
licensed to do so by the State in which the
school zone is located or a political subdivision of the State, and the law of the State or
political subdivision requires that, before an
individual obtains such a license, the law enforcement authorities of the State or political
subdivision verify that the individual is qualified under law to receive the license;
(iii) that is—
(I) not loaded; and
(II) in a locked container, or a locked firearms rack that is on a motor vehicle;
(iv) by an individual for use in a program approved by a school in the school zone;
(v) by an individual in accordance with a
contract entered into between a school in the
school zone and the individual or an employer
of the individual;
(vi) by a law enforcement officer acting in
his or her official capacity; or
(vii) that is unloaded and is possessed by an
individual while traversing school premises for
the purpose of gaining access to public or private lands open to hunting, if the entry on
school premises is authorized by school authorities.
(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B),
it shall be unlawful for any person, knowingly or
with reckless disregard for the safety of another, to discharge or attempt to discharge a
firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce at a place
that the person knows is a school zone.
(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the
discharge of a firearm—
(i) on private property not part of school
grounds;
(ii) as part of a program approved by a
school in the school zone, by an individual who
is participating in the program;
(iii) by an individual in accordance with a
contract entered into between a school in a
school zone and the individual or an employer
of the individual; or
(iv) by a law enforcement officer acting in
his or her official capacity.
(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preempting or preventing a State or
local government from enacting a statute establishing gun free school zones as provided in this
subsection.
(r) It shall be unlawful for any person to assemble from imported parts any semiautomatic
rifle or any shotgun which is identical to any
rifle or shotgun prohibited from importation§ 922 TITLE 18—CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE Page 214

being particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes except that this subsection shall not apply to—
(1) the assembly of any such rifle or shotgun
for sale or distribution by a licensed manufacturer to the United States or any department
or agency thereof or to any State or any department, agency, or political subdivision
thereof; or
(2) the assembly of any such rifle or shotgun
for the purposes of testing or experimentation
authorized by the Attorney General.
(s)(1) Beginning on the date that is 90 days
after the date of enactment of this subsection
and ending on the day before the date that is 60
months after such date of enactment, it shall be
unlawful for any licensed importer, licensed
manufacturer, or licensed dealer to sell, deliver,
or transfer a handgun (other than the return of
a handgun to the person from whom it was received) to an individual who is not licensed

of the statement to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of
the transferee; and
(ii)(I) 5 business days (meaning days on
which State offices are open) have elapsed
from the date the transferor furnished notice of the contents of the statement to the
chief law enforcement officer, during which
period the transferor has not received information from the chief law enforcement officer that receipt or possession of the handgun
by the transferee would be in violation of
Federal, State, or local law; or

transfer under section 5812 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
(F) on application of the transferor, the Attorney General has certified that compliance

transfer is to occur to the number of square
miles of land area of the State does not exceed 0.0025;
(ii) the business premises of the transferor
at which the transfer is to occur are extremely remote in relation to the chief law
enforcement officer; and
(iii) there is an absence of telecommunications facilities in the geographical area in
which the business premises are located.
(2) A chief law enforcement officer to whom a
transferor has provided notice pursuant to paragraph (1)(A)(i)(III) shall make a reasonable effort to ascertain within 5 business days whether
receipt or possession would be in violation of the
law, including research in whatever State and
local recordkeeping systems are available and in
a national system designated by the Attorney
General.
(3) The statement referred to in paragraph
(1)(A)(i)(I) shall contain only—

of paragraph (1)(A)(i) with respect to the statement.
(B) Unless the chief law enforcement officer to
whom a statement is transmitted under paragraph (1)(A)(i)(IV) determines that a transaction
would violate Federal, State, or local law—
(i) the officer shall, within 20 business days

(t)(1) Beginning on the date that is 30 days
after the Attorney General notifies licensees
under section 103(d) of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act that the national instant
criminal background check system is established, a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer shall not transfer a firearm to any other person who is not licensed
under this chapter, unless—
(A) before the completion of the transfer,
the licensee contacts the national instant
criminal background check system established
under section 103 of that Act;
(B)(i) the system provides the licensee with
a unique identification number; or
(ii) 3 business days (meaning a day on which
State offices are open) have elapsed since the
licensee contacted the system, and the system
has not notified the licensee that the receipt

(C) the transferor has verified the identity of
the transferee by examining a valid identification document (as defined in section 1028(d) of
this title) of the transferee containing a photograph of the transferee.
(2) If receipt of a firearm would not violate
subsection (g) or (n) or State law, the system
shall—

number and the date the number was assigned)
and all records of the system relating to the
person or the transfer.
(3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a firearm
transfer between a licensee and another person
if—
(A)(i) such other person has presented to the
licensee a permit that—
(I) allows such other person to possess or
acquire a firearm; and
(II) was issued not more than 5 years earlier by the State in which the transfer is to
take place; and
(ii) the law of the State provides that such a
permit is to be issued only after an authorized§ 922 TITLE 18—CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE Page 216
government official has verified that the information available to such official does not indicate that possession of a firearm by such other
person would be in violation of law;
(B) the Attorney General has approved the
transfer under section 5812 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
(C) on application of the transferor, the Attorney General has certified that compliance
with paragraph (1)(A) is impracticable because—
(i) the ratio of the number of law enforcement officers of the State in which the
transfer is to occur to the number of square
miles of land area of the State does not exceed 0.0025;
(ii) the business premises of the licensee at
which the transfer is to occur are extremely

(4) If the national instant criminal background check system notifies the licensee that
the information available to the system does
not demonstrate that the receipt of a firearm by
such other person would violate subsection (g)
or (n) or State law, and the licensee transfers a
firearm to such other person, the licensee shall
include in the record of the transfer the unique
identification number provided by the system
with respect to the transfer.
(5) If the licensee knowingly transfers a firearm to such other person and knowingly fails to
comply with paragraph (1) of this subsection
with respect to the transfer and, at the time
such other person most recently proposed the

SYSTEM
Pub. L. 110–180, Jan. 8, 2008, 121 Stat. 2559, provided
that:
‘‘SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND TABLE OF CONTENTS.
‘‘(a) SHORT TILE [sic].—This Act may be cited as the
‘NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007’.
‘‘(b) Table of Contents.—[Omitted.]
‘‘SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
‘‘Congress finds the following:
‘‘(1) Approximately 916,000 individuals were prohibited from purchasing a firearm for failing a background check between November 30, 1998, (the date
the National Instant Criminal Background Check
System (NICS) began operating) and December 31,
2004.
‘‘(2) From November 30, 1998, through December 31,
2004, nearly 49,000,000 Brady background checks were
processed through NICS.
‘‘(3) Although most Brady background checks are
processed through NICS in seconds, many background
checks are delayed if the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) does not have automated access to
complete information from the States concerning
persons prohibited from possessing or receiving a
firearm under Federal or State law.
‘‘(4) Nearly 21,000,000 criminal records are not accessible by NICS and millions of criminal records are
missing critical data, such as arrest dispositions, due
to data backlogs.
‘‘(5) The primary cause of delay in NICS background checks is the lack of—
‘‘(A) updates and available State criminal disposition records; and
‘‘(B) automated access to information concerning
persons prohibited from possessing or receiving a
firearm because of mental illness, restraining orders, or misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence.
‘‘(6) Automated access to this information can be
improved by—
‘‘(A) computerizing information relating to criminal history, criminal dispositions, mental illness,
restraining orders, and misdemeanor convictions
for domestic violence; or
‘‘(B) making such information available to NICS
in a usable format.
‘‘(7) Helping States to automate these records will
reduce delays for law-abiding gun purchasers.
‘‘(8) On March 12, 2002, the senseless shooting, which
took the lives of a priest and a parishioner at the Our
Lady of Peace Church in Lynbrook, New York,
brought attention to the need to improve information-sharing that would enable Federal and State law
enforcement agencies to conduct a complete backPage 223 TITLE 18—CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE § 922
ground check on a potential firearm purchaser. The
man who committed this double murder had a prior
disqualifying mental health commitment and a restraining order against him, but passed a Brady background check because NICS did not have the necessary information to determine that he was ineligible to purchase a firearm under Federal or State
law.
‘‘(9) On April 16, 2007, a student with a history of
mental illness at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University shot to death 32 students and
faculty members, wounded 17 more, and then took his
own life. The shooting, the deadliest campus shooting
in United States history, renewed the need to improve information-sharing that would enable Federal
and State law enforcement agencies to conduct complete background checks on potential firearms purchasers. In spite of a proven history of mental illness,
the shooter was able to purchase the two firearms
used in the shooting. Improved coordination between
State and Federal authorities could have ensured
that the shooter’s disqualifying mental health information was available to NICS.
‘‘SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
‘‘As used in this Act, the following definitions shall
apply:
‘‘(1) COURT ORDER.—The term ‘court order’ includes
a court order (as described in section 922(g)(8) of title
18, United States Code).
‘‘(2) MENTAL HEALTH TERMS.—The terms ‘adjudicated as a mental defective’ and ‘committed to a
mental institution’ have the same meanings as in
section 922(g)(4) of title 18, United States Code.

of a personal collection of firearms, subject only
to such restrictions as apply in this chapter to
dispositions by a person other than a licensed
manufacturer, importer, or dealer. If any firearm is so disposed of by a licensee within one
year after its transfer from his business inventory into such licensee’s personal collection or if
such disposition or any other acquisition is
made for the purpose of willfully evading the restrictions placed upon licensees by this chapter,
then such firearm shall be deemed part of such
licensee’s business inventory, except that any licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer who
has maintained a firearm as part of a personal
collection for one year and who sells or otherwise disposes of such firearm shall record the description of the firearm in a bound volume, containing the name and place of residence and date

of this chapter;
(C) the applicant has not willfully violated
any of the provisions of this chapter or regulations issued thereunder;

(E) the applicant has in a State (i) premises
from which he conducts business subject to license under this chapter or from which he intends to conduct such business within a reasonable period of time, or (ii) in the case of a

(F) the applicant certifies that—
(i) the business to be conducted under the
license is not prohibited by State or local
law in the place where the licensed premise
is located;

is approved the business will comply with
the requirements of State and local law applicable to the conduct of the business; and

(iii) that the applicant has sent or delivered a form to be prescribed by the Attorney
General, to the chief law enforcement officer
of the locality in which the premises are located, which indicates that the applicant intends to apply for a Federal firearms license;
and
(G) in the case of an application to be licensed as a dealer, the applicant certifies that
secure gun storage or safety devices will be
available at any place in which firearms are
sold under the license to persons who are not
licensees (subject to the exception that in any
case in which a secure gun storage or safety
device is temporarily unavailable because of
theft, casualty loss, consumer sales, backorders from a manufacturer, or any other
similar reason beyond the control of the licensee, the dealer shall not be considered to be
in violation of the requirement under this subparagraph to make available such a device).
(2) The Attorney General must approve or
deny an application for a license within the 60-
day period beginning on the date it is received.
If the Attorney General fails to act within such
period, the applicant may file an action under
section 1361 of title 28 to compel the Attorney
General to act. If the Attorney General approves
an applicant’s application, such applicant shall
be issued a license upon the payment of the prescribed fee.
(e) The Attorney General may, after notice
and opportunity for hearing, revoke any license
issued under this section if the holder of such license has willfully violated any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation prescribed by
the Attorney General under this chapter or fails
to have secure gun storage or safety devices
available at any place in which firearms are sold
under the license to persons who are not licensees (except that in any case in which a secure gun storage or safety device is temporarily
unavailable because of theft, casualty loss, consumer sales, backorders from a manufacturer, or
any other similar reason beyond the control of
the licensee, the dealer shall not be considered
to be in violation of the requirement to make
available such a device). The Attorney General
may, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
revoke the license of a dealer who willfully
transfers armor piercing ammunition. The Secretary’s1 action under this subsection may be
reviewed only as provided in subsection (f) of
this section.
(f)(1) Any person whose application for a license is denied and any holder of a license which
is revoked shall receive a written notice from
the Attorney General stating specifically the
grounds upon which the application was denied
or upon which the license was revoked. Any notice of a revocation of a license shall be given to
the holder of such license before the effective
date of the revocation.
(2) If the Attorney General denies an application for, or revokes, a license, he shall, upon request by the aggrieved party, promptly hold a
hearing to review his denial or revocation. In
the case of a revocation of a license, the Attorney General shall upon the request of the holder
of the license stay the effective date of the revocation. A hearing held under this paragraph
shall be held at a location convenient to the aggrieved party.
(3) If after a hearing held under paragraph (2)
the Attorney General decides not to reverse his
decision to deny an application or revoke a license, the Attorney General shall give notice of
his decision to the aggrieved party. The aggrieved party may at any time within sixty days
after the date notice was given under this paragraph file a petition with the United States district court for the district in which he resides or
has his principal place of business for a de novo
judicial review of such denial or revocation. In a
proceeding conducted under this subsection, the
court may consider any evidence submitted by
the parties to the proceeding whether or not
such evidence was considered at the hearing
held under paragraph (2). If the court decides
that the Attorney General was not authorized to
deny the application or to revoke the license,
the court shall order the Attorney General to
take such action as may be necessary to comply
with the judgment of the court.
(4) If criminal proceedings are instituted
against a licensee alleging any violation of this
chapter or of rules or regulations prescribed
under this chapter, and the licensee is acquitted
of such charges, or such proceedings are terminated, other than upon motion of the Government before trial upon such charges, the Attorney General shall be absolutely barred from denying or revoking any license granted under
this chapter where such denial or revocation is
based in whole or in part on the facts which
form the basis of such criminal charges. No proceedings for the revocation of a license shall be
instituted by the Attorney General more than
one year after the filing of the indictment or information.
(g)(1)(A) Each licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, and licensed dealer shall maintain
such records of importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms at his place of business for such period, and
in such form, as the Attorney General may by
regulations prescribe. Such importers, manufacturers, and dealers shall not be required to submit to the Attorney General reports and information with respect to such records and the contents thereof, except as expressly required by
this section. The Attorney General, when he has
reasonable cause to believe a violation of this
chapter has occurred and that evidence thereof
may be found on such premises, may, upon demonstrating such cause before a Federal magistrate judge and securing from such magistrate
judge a warrant authorizing entry, enter during
business hours the premises (including places of
storage) of any licensed firearms importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, licensed
collector, or any licensed importer or manufacturer of ammunition, for the purpose of inspecting or examining—
(i) any records or documents required to be
kept by such licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector under this chapter or rules or regulations
under this chapter, andPage 231 TITLE 18—CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE § 923
(ii) any firearms or ammunition kept or
stored by such licensed importer, licensed
manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, at such premises.
(B) The Attorney General may inspect or examine the inventory and records of a licensed
importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed
dealer without such reasonable cause or warrant—
(i) in the course of a reasonable inquiry during the course of a criminal investigation of a
person or persons other than the licensee;
(ii) for ensuring compliance with the record
keeping requirements of this chapter—
(I) not more than once during any 12-
month period; or
(II) at any time with respect to records relating to a firearm involved in a criminal investigation that is traced to the licensee; or
(iii) when such inspection or examination
may be required for determining the disposition of one or more particular firearms in the
course of a bona fide criminal investigation.
(C) The Attorney General may inspect the inventory and records of a licensed collector without such reasonable cause or warrant—
(i) for ensuring compliance with the record

may be required for determining the disposition of one or more particular firearms in the
course of a bona fide criminal investigation.

annual inspection of records and inventory permitted under this paragraph shall be performed
at the office of the Attorney General designated
for such inspections which is located in closest
proximity to the premises where the inventory
and records of such licensed collector are maintained. The inspection and examination authorized by this paragraph shall not be construed as
authorizing the Attorney General to seize any
records or other documents other than those
records or documents constituting material evidence of a violation of law. If the Attorney General seizes such records or documents, copies
shall be provided the licensee within a reasonable time. The Attorney General may make
available to any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency any information which he
may obtain by reason of this chapter with respect to the identification of persons prohibited
from purchasing or receiving firearms or ammunition who have purchased or received firearms
or ammunition, together with a description of
such firearms or ammunition, and he may provide information to the extent such information
may be contained in the records required to be
maintained by this chapter, when so requested
by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement
agency.
(2) Each licensed collector shall maintain in a
bound volume the nature of which the Attorney
General may by regulations prescribe, records of
the receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms. Such records shall include the name and
address of any person to whom the collector
sells or otherwise disposes of a firearm. Such
collector shall not be required to submit to the
Attorney General reports and information with
respect to such records and the contents thereof,
except as expressly required by this section.
(3)(A) Each licensee shall prepare a report of
multiple sales or other dispositions whenever
the licensee sells or otherwise disposes of, at one
time or during any five consecutive business
days, two or more pistols, or revolvers, or any
combination of pistols and revolvers totalling
two or more, to an unlicensed person. The report
shall be prepared on a form specified by the Attorney General and forwarded to the office specified thereon and to the department of State police or State law enforcement agency of the
State or local law enforcement agency of the
local jurisdiction in which the sale or other disposition took place, not later than the close of
business on the day that the multiple sale or
other disposition occurs.
(B) Except in the case of forms and contents
thereof regarding a purchaser who is prohibited
by subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of this
title from receipt of a firearm, the department
of State police or State law enforcement agency
or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction shall not disclose any such form or
the contents thereof to any person or entity,
and shall destroy each such form and any record
of the contents thereof no more than 20 days
from the date such form is received. No later
than the date that is 6 months after the effective date of this subparagraph, and at the end of
each 6-month period thereafter, the department
of State police or State law enforcement agency
or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction shall certify to the Attorney General
of the United States that no disclosure contrary
to this subparagraph has been made and that all
forms and any record of the contents thereof
have been destroyed as provided in this subparagraph.
(4) Where a firearms or ammunition business
is discontinued and succeeded by a new licensee,
the records required to be kept by this chapter
shall appropriately reflect such facts and shall
be delivered to the successor. Where discontinuance of the business is absolute, such records
shall be delivered within thirty days after the
business discontinuance to the Attorney General. However, where State law or local ordinance requires the delivery of records to other
responsible authority, the Attorney General
may arrange for the delivery of such records to
such other responsible authority.
(5)(A) Each licensee shall, when required by
letter issued by the Attorney General, and until
notified to the contrary in writing by the Attorney General, submit on a form specified by the
Attorney General, for periods and at the times
specified in such letter, all record information
required to be kept by this chapter or such lesser record information as the Attorney General
in such letter may specify.
(B) The Attorney General may authorize such
record information to be submitted in a manner
other than that prescribed in subparagraph (A)
of this paragraph when it is shown by a licensee
that an alternate method of reporting is reasonably necessary and will not unduly hinder the
effective administration of this chapter. A li§ 923 TITLE 18—CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE Page 232
censee may use an alternate method of reporting if the licensee describes the proposed alternate method of reporting and the need therefor
in a letter application submitted to the Attorney General, and the Attorney General approves
such alternate method of reporting.
(6) Each licensee shall report the theft or loss
of a firearm from the licensee’s inventory or collection, within 48 hours after the theft or loss is
discovered, to the Attorney General and to the
appropriate local authorities.
(7) Each licensee shall respond immediately
to, and in no event later than 24 hours after the
receipt of, a request by the Attorney General for
information contained in the records required to
be kept by this chapter as may be required for
determining the disposition of 1 or more firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation. The requested information shall be
provided orally or in writing, as the Attorney
General may require. The Attorney General
shall implement a system whereby the licensee
can positively identify and establish that an individual requesting information via telephone is
employed by and authorized by the agency to request such information.
(h) Licenses issued under the provisions of
subsection (c) of this section shall be kept posted and kept available for inspection on the
premises covered by the license.
(i) Licensed importers and licensed manufacturers shall identify by means of a serial number engraved or cast on the receiver or frame of
the weapon, in such manner as the Attorney
General shall by regulations prescribe, each firearm imported or manufactured by such importer
or manufacturer.
(j) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer,
or licensed dealer may, under rules or regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, conduct business temporarily at a location other
than the location specified on the license if such
temporary location is the location for a gun
show or event sponsored by any national, State,
or local organization, or any affiliate of any
such organization devoted to the collection,
competitive use, or other sporting use of firearms in the community, and such location is in
the State which is specified on the license.
Records of receipt and disposition of firearms
transactions conducted at such temporary location shall include the location of the sale or
other disposition and shall be entered in the permanent records of the licensee and retained on
the location specified on the license. Nothing in
this subsection shall authorize any licensee to
conduct business in or from any motorized or
towed vehicle. Notwithstanding the provisions
of subsection (a) of this section, a separate fee
shall not be required of a licensee with respect
to business conducted under this subsection.
Any inspection or examination of inventory or
records under this chapter by the Attorney General at such temporary location shall be limited
to inventory consisting of, or records relating
to, firearms held or disposed at such temporary
location. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to authorize the Attorney General to
inspect or examine the inventory or records of a
licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer at any location other than the location specified on the license. Nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to diminish in any
manner any right to display, sell, or otherwise
dispose of firearms or ammunition, which is in
effect before the date of the enactment of the
Firearms Owners’ Protection Act, including the
right of a licensee to conduct ‘‘curios or relics’’
firearms transfers and business away from their
business premises with another licensee without
regard as to whether the location of where the
business is conducted is located in the State
specified on the license of either licensee.
(k) Licensed importers and licensed manufacturers shall mark all armor piercing projectiles
and packages containing such projectiles for distribution in the manner prescribed by the Attorney General by regulation. The Attorney General shall furnish information to each dealer licensed under this chapter defining which projectiles are considered armor piercing ammunition
as defined in section 921(a)(17)(B).
(l) The Attorney General shall notify the chief
law enforcement officer in the appropriate State
and local jurisdictions of the names and addresses of all persons in the State to whom a firearms
license is issued.

(2) The provisions of this chapter, except for
provisions relating to firearms subject to the
prohibitions of section 922(p), shall not apply
with respect to (A) the shipment or receipt of§ 925 TITLE 18—CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE Page 242
firearms or ammunition when sold or issued by
the Secretary of the Army pursuant to section
4308 of title 10 before the repeal of such section
by section 1624(a) of the Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety
Act, and (B) the transportation of any such firearm or ammunition carried out to enable a person, who lawfully received such firearm or ammunition from the Secretary of the Army, to engage in military training or in competitions.
(3) Unless otherwise prohibited by this chapter, except for provisions relating to firearms
subject to the prohibitions of section 922(p), or
any other Federal law, a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer may
ship to a member of the United States Armed
Forces on active duty outside the United States
or to clubs, recognized by the Department of Defense, whose entire membership is composed of
such members, and such members or clubs may
receive a firearm or ammunition determined by
the Attorney General to be generally recognized
as particularly suitable for sporting purposes
and intended for the personal use of such member or club.
(4) When established to the satisfaction of the
Attorney General to be consistent with the provisions of this chapter, except for provisions relating to firearms subject to the prohibitions of
section 922(p), and other applicable Federal and
State laws and published ordinances, the Attorney General may authorize the transportation,
shipment, receipt, or importation into the
United States to the place of residence of any
member of the United States Armed Forces who
is on active duty outside the United States (or
who has been on active duty outside the United
States within the sixty day period immediately
preceding the transportation, shipment, receipt,
or importation), of any firearm or ammunition
which is (A) determined by the Attorney General to be generally recognized as particularly
suitable for sporting purposes, or determined by

(c) A person who is prohibited from possessing,
shipping, transporting, or receiving firearms or
ammunition may make application to the Attorney General for relief from the disabilities
imposed by Federal laws with respect to the acquisition, receipt, transfer, shipment, transportation, or possession of firearms, and the Attorney General may grant such relief if it is established to his satisfaction that the circumstances
regarding the disability, and the applicant’s
record and reputation, are such that the applicant will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of
the relief would not be contrary to the public interest. Any person whose application for relief
from disabilities is denied by the Attorney General may file a petition with the United States
district court for the district in which he resides
for a judicial review of such denial. The court
may in its discretion admit additional evidence
where failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice. A licensed importer, licensed

therefor.

except in any case where the Attorney General
has not authorized the importation of the firearm pursuant to this paragraph, it shall be unlawful to import any frame, receiver, or barrel
of such firearm which would be prohibited if
assembled; or

States or a possession by the person who is
bringing in the firearm or ammunition.
